<p class="title">Google Analytics </p>
<p class="item">This panel lets you easily navigate <strong>Google Analytics</strong> website without opening an external browser window. The navigation bar is hidden by default, but you can make it visible by clicking on the <span class="itemelement">Navigate</span> bar; the familiar <span class="itemelement">Back</span>, <span class="itemelement">Forward</span>, <span class="itemelement">Home</span>, <span class="itemelement">Reload</span> and <span class="itemelement">Stop</span> buttons will then appear. </p>
<p class="item">Google Analytics is the most widespread web analytics solution; it gives you rich insights into your website traffic and marketing  effectiveness. If you already use Analytics on your website, you will  be able to easily track your e-mail campaigns too: just use <span class="itemelement">Google Analytics</span> button in SendBlaster's <a href="sendblaster_messages_compose.htm" class="itemlink">message editing panel</a>:</p>
<ol class="item">
  <li>Compose your message and insert links</li>
  <li>Once you're finished, click on <span class="itemelement">Google Analytics</span> button</li>
  <li>Enter your campaign details (please see Google Analytics website if you need help)</li>
</ol>
<p class="item">All links in the message will be automatically updated so that they include the needed Google Analytics code. Since the original HTML code is modified, adding Google Analytics code must always happen only after the editing of the message is finished (in other words, it must be tha last thing you do when you compose your message)*. </p>
<p class="item">Please remember that <strong>Google Analytics must already be installed on your website</strong> (or on the website recipients are redirected to). You need to be familiar with the service in order to be able to understand the tracking information it provides. </p>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<p class="item">*Except when you want some links not to be tracked: in that case, you need to add the un-tracked links after Google Analytics code has been added to the message. Furthermore, if you want to use both Google Analytics and <a href="sendblaster_messages_trackreports.htm" class="itemlink">TrackReports</a>, add Google Analytics first and TrackReports last (as it uses a redirection system). </p>
