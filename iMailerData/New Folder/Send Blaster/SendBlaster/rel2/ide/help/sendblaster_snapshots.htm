<p class="title">Snapshots</p>
<p class="item">Snapshots are a powerful new feature that allows users to save all settings
for a given panel and reuse them later with just one click - it is as easy as taking a snapshot! Whether you are setting your delivery options, or configuring the way a file should be imported, never reconfigure anything from scratch again - save a snapshot, reload it later, and you're done. </p>

<p class="item">Snapshots extend the concept of &quot;profiles&quot; to a new level: almost every group
of related settings in SendBlaster can be saved as a snapshot. Look for <span class="itemelement">Take snapshot </span> and <span class="itemelement">Load snapshot </span> buttons in the upper right part of most panels.</p>
