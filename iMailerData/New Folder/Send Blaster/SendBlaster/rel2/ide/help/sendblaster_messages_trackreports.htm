<p class="title">TrackReports</p>
<p class="item">This panel lets you easily navigate <strong>TrackReports</strong> website without opening an external browser window. The navigation bar is hidden by default, but you can make it visible by clicking on the <span class="itemelement">Navigate</span> bar; the familiar <span class="itemelement">Back</span>, <span class="itemelement">Forward</span>, <span class="itemelement">Home</span>, <span class="itemelement">Reload</span> and <span class="itemelement">Stop</span> buttons will then appear. </p>
<p class="item">TrackReports is an online service which allows you to track your campaigns: how many people opened your newsletter, how many of them actually clicked on links, and so on; it displays collected data using detailed charts. In order to start tracking your mailing, just use <span class="itemelement">TrackReports</span> button in SendBlaster's <a href="sendblaster_messages_compose.htm" class="itemlink">message editing panel</a>:</p>
<ol class="item">
  <li>Compose your message and insert links</li>
  <li>Once you're finished, connect to the Internet (if you are not already connected) and click on <span class="itemelement">TrackReports</span> button</li>
  <li>Enter your TrackReports account (you need to register if you don't have an account already) </li>
  <li>Enter a new, unique title for your mailing or choose an existing one (please see TrackReports website if you need help)</li>
</ol>
<p class="item">All links in the message will be automatically updated so that they include the needed TrackReports code and redirection system; a &quot;tracking image&quot; is also added to the message. Since the original HTML code is modified, adding TrackReports code must always happen only after the editing of the message is finished (in other words, it must be tha last thing you do when you compose your message)*.</p>
<p class="item">You must be online in order to successfully add TrackReports code to your message, as this operation requires access to TrackReports online API. </p>
<p class="item">TrackReports is currently in beta stage, and therefore, at the moment of writing, offered as a free service to SendBlaster users. Please be aware that, while SendBlaster has full integration with the service, <strong>TrackReports is not part of SendBlaster (the software) itself</strong> and may be offered as a paid subscription service in the future; it is currently offered &quot;as is&quot; with no warranties. </p>
<p class="item"><font color="#FF0000">Warning:</font> TrackReports uses a redirection mechanism (much like an url shortener); should TrackReports' web server go down, all tracked links will be unreachable (your recipients will not be able to open your links). We suggest you do not use TrackReports or other redirection systems (url shorteners, etc) in critical communications. </p>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<p class="item">*Except when you want some links not to be tracked: in that case, you need to add the un-tracked links after TrackReports code has been added to the message. If you want to use both <a href="sendblaster_messages_googleanalytics.htm" class="itemlink">Google Analytics</a> and TrackReports, add Google Analytics first and TrackReports last (as it uses a redirection system).</p>
