<p class="title"> Manage subscriptions</p>
<p class="item">SendBlaster can automatically manage subscriptions (and unsubscriptions) 
  to distribution lists. Each list can be associated with an e-mail address: when 
  a message with &quot;Subscribe&quot; in the subject line is sent to this e-mail
  address the sender gets added to the list. If the subject is &quot;Unsubscribe&quot;
  instead, the sender gets deleted (if case he/she was previously subscribed).
  SendBlaster downloads new messages from the POP3 account, verifies the subject
  and updates the related distribution list.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="item"><font color="#FF0000">Note:</font>
    Default subject lines (&quot;Subscribe&quot; for subscriptions, and &quot;Unsubscribe&quot;
    for cancelations) can be changed from the
    <a href="sendblaster_settings_advancedsettings.htm" class="itemelement">Advanced Settings</a>
    window.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p class="item"><font color="#FF0000">Warning:</font>
    The address chosen for managing subscriptions must allow POP3 messages downloading
    (the same protocol used by standard e-mail clients). It's not possible to
    use addresses that can be only managed via web (for instance the Hotmail services).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="item">Normally each list will be assigned a dedicated e-mail address.
  However, it is possible to assign the same e-mail address to more than one list.
  In this case, when a list is updated, all other lists that use the same Subscribe/Unsubscribe
  address will also be updated. For instance, if you create 2 lists named &quot;List
  1&quot; and &quot;List 2&quot; and they are both linked to the same managing
  e-mail address, by downloading the messages to update &quot;List 1&quot;, &quot;List
  2&quot; would also get updated.</p>
<p class="item">Each list's managing address is set by typing the correct parameters
  to access the POP3 account, just like in an e-mail client software: besides
  the address (<span class="itemelement">E-mail</span>) you need to specify the
  receiving server (<span class="itemelement">POP3 Server</span>), the
  <span class="itemelement">Port</span> number (if no port is specified, default port
  110 will be used), the <span class="itemelement">Username</span>
  and the <span class="itemelement">Password</span>. The <span class="itemelement">SSL</span>
  checkbox enables SSL communication, which may be needed by some pop3 servers 
  (a typical example is Gmail's server). In the <span class="itemelement">Timeout</span>
  field you can type the number of seconds of inactivity after which the connection
  will be closed. To verify the parameters just click on <span class="itemelement">Connection test
  </span> button (no message will be downloaded).</p>
<p class="item">Under certain, hard to predict circumstances, your POP3 server may need to slow down the downloading of messages; if you are experiencing difficulties, you may want to try enabling the <span class="itemelement">Slower</span> checkbox (there is no recurrent path here, just try either method and see which one works better). </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="item"><font color="#FF0000">Tip:</font>
    <span class="itemelement">Profiles</span> button allows to manage multiple POP3
    settings. Account information can be
    stored for multiple profiles, so all POP3 settings are saved/loaded
    with a couple of clicks. This feature is specially useful when sending mails
    on behalf of someone else; or just to quickly
  save a profile that you can use later in the same list, or any other list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="item">By checking <span class="itemelement">Keep a copy of the messages
  on the server once downloaded</span>, SendBlaster will download new messages without deleting
  them from the server. The messages will then be available for future uses. New
  messages will be ignored.</p>
<p class="item">By checking <span class="itemelement">Only delete new subscription and
cancellation messages</span> SendBlaster will delete only messages which have been recognized as subscriptions or cancellations; this is really
useful if you use the same management email address to receive non management emails, like
readers' replies, and other messages.</p>
<p class="item"><span class="itemelement">Update all fields</span> is an extremely 
  powerful option: when checked, not only subject but the whole message body will 
  be processed; if message body contains <em>fieldname: value</em> lines, not 
  only contact record's email address but other fields will be updated accordingly 
  too (<a href="#updateallfields">see box below</a>).</p>
<p class="item">The drawback is that messages downloading and processing will
  be significantly slower; therefore it is strongly suggested that <span class="itemelement">Update 
  all fields</span> is only checked when really needed, which means when your 
  website generates subscription mails containing not only addresses but other 
  fields too.</p>
<p class="item">By clicking on the <span class="itemelement">Download</span> button, 
  the new messages will be downloaded and the selected distribution list will 
  be updated (as well as all other lists that use the same managing e-mail address).</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFF99" class="item"> <p><font color="#009900"><strong>Which 
        address should I use?</strong></font></p>
      <p>It is advisable to dedicate a different subscribe/unsubscribe e-mail 
        address for each ditribution list, that is, an address that is not used 
        for any standard e-mail sending and receiving. This will minimize the 
        risk of receiving spam (that will be ignored) and will make it easy to 
        manage the lists. In an environment of this kind it won't be necessary 
        to enable the <span class="itemelement">Keep a copy of the messages on 
        the server</span> option since the mails won't have to be read by other 
        softwares. This way, message downloading will be faster and, most of all, 
        the account space will be preserved. Some services have a limit on the 
        total amount of space that the messages can occupy, and if the given space 
        gets filled, no more messages are delivered.</p>
      <p>It is also possible, but not advisable, to use a &quot;standard&quot; 
        address, also used on another e-mail client to send and receive messages. 
        This way, it is absolutely necessary to enable the <span class="itemelement">Keep 
        a copy of the messages on the server</span> option or the
        <span class="itemelement">Only delete new subscription and
cancelation messages</span> option
        (or else, once the
        messages are downloaded they get removed from server). And even more important
        is that even the standard e-mail client is set accordingly, in order to
        allow SendBlaster to read the messages (in Outlook Express after selecting
        an account choose <em>Properties / Advanced settings / Keep a copy of
        the messages on the server</em>).</p>

      <p>While &quot;normal&quot; processing makes SendBlaster download and process 
        message subjects only, <span class="itemelement">Update all fields</span> 
        option will let SendBlaster download and process whole message bodies, 
        search for lines in the <em>fieldname: value</em> format inside message 
        body, and update fields accordingly.</p>
      <p>Suppose you have two fields named &quot;Surname&quot; and &quot;City&quot;; 
        if a message is received from &quot;aaa@aaa.com&quot; with &quot;Subscribe&quot; 
        as subject and the following body (please note that each line contains 
        a different field):</p>
      <p>Surname: Smith<br>
        City: New York</p>
      <p>a new contact &quot;aaa@aaa.com&quot; is added to the list, having &quot;Smith&quot; 
        as &quot;Surname&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; as &quot;City&quot;.</p>
      <p>Some other syntax formats, using the same <span class="itemelement">Tags</span>

        are allowed too: <em>#tag#: value</em> and <em>#fieldnumber#: value</em> 
        as in the following examples:</p>
      <p>#surname#: Smith<br>
        #city#: New York</p>
