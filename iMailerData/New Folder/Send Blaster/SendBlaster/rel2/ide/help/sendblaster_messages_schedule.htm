<p class="title">Schedule</p>
<p class="item">SendBlaster allows to schedule messages, so they can be sent at a specified time. Mailings can also be &quot;parked&quot;: they are ready for being sent, but will not be automatically launched - user will manually launch a parked mailing at a later time.</p>
<p class="item"><font color="#FF0000">Important:</font> <strong>Scheduled mailings are only launched when SendBlaster is in &quot;Schedule mode&quot;</strong> - in other words, when it's minimized in the tray area. <strong>No mailings, even if the scheduled time has elapsed, will be automatically launched if the software is in &quot;normal&quot; mode</strong>. Click on <span class="itemelement">Run in schedule mode </span> button when you want SendBlaster to be minimized in the tray area and process scheduled mailings (you can revert back to normal mode by clicking on the its icon in the system tray).</p>
<p class="item">The Schedule
  screen shows a toolbar and the list of scheduled mailing operations. </p>
<p class="item">Each scheduled mailing operation shows: whether the scheduled operation is active or not, the date and time when mailing operation will start, the mailing
operation title, the destination list for the mailing operation and the subject of the scheduled
mail message. Columns can be resized.</p>
<p class="item">The scheduled mailing operations can be freely sorted by clicking on column headers.
<p class="item">On top of the address list you can find the schedule toolbar.
  You can access these commands also through the context menu that is displayed
  when right-clicking with the mouse on the list.</p>
<p class="item">You can schedule current mailing operation (button <span class="itemelement">New</span>),
  change schedule date for the selected scheduled mailing operation (<span class="itemelement">Edit date</span>),
  preview the selected scheduled message (<span class="itemelement">E-mail preview</span>),
  start the selected mailing operation (<span class="itemelement">Send Now</span>),
  or delete one or more mailing operations (<span class="itemelement">Delete</span>).</p>
