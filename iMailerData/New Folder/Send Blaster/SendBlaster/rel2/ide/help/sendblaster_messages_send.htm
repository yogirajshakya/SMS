<p class="title">Sending messages</p>
<p class="item">In order to send a message you first need to specify the recipients 
  and the sender.</p>
<p class="item">The list of distribution lists (defined in <a href="sendblaster_lists_managing.htm" class="itemelement">Manage 
  lists</a>) is shown in the <span class="itemelement">Select distribution list</span>
  field. Select one and the addresses in the list will be used as recipients. 
  Each contact will receive a personal message.</p>
<p class="item">The message sender will be specified in the <span class="itemelement">Sender</span> 
  <span class="itemelement">e-mail address</span> and <span class="itemelement">Sender 
  name </span>fields. You can freely type in these fields or select an address 
  and a name from the comboboxes, which display the last 10 names and addresses 
  previously used in sending operations (the lists will be empty if no message 
  has ever been sent). If a subscription/unsubscription address was provided to 
  the selected distribution list, it will be automatically shown as the message 
  sender address. However this is just default behavior, the address and/or the 
  name can be manually changed.<br>
  You can also optionally specify a <span class="itemelement">Reply-To</span><span class="itemelement"> 
  address</span>: this is the address replies will be sent to. If it is left blank, 
  replies will be sent to the sender address (this is the default behaviour for 
  personal e-mail messages).</p>
<p class="item">To send the message just click on the <span class="itemelement">Send</span>
  button. Obviously if it's the first sending operation, or if the connection
  settings have changed, it will be necessary to first set up the <span class="itemelement">Send
  settings</span>, otherwise the message won't be sent.</p>
<p class="item">
As an alternative to sending messages, it is possible to <b>schedule</b> the mailing operation, and let SendBlaster
send it later automatically, at a given day and time, or even <b>"park"</b> the mailing operation to be manually
launched later, in order to schedule a mailing operation, just click the <span class="itemelement">Send later...</span>
button.
</p>
<p class="item">Two <span class="itemelement">Send mode</span>s are available:<span class="itemelement">
  Use SMTP server</span> and <span class="itemelement">Direct send.</span></p>
<ul>
<p>
<li class="item">By selecting <span class="itemelement">Use SMTP server</span>,
    e-mail sending will take place just like in a standard e-mail client, that
    is, by delivering the message to one's own ISP SMTP server. It is therefore
    necessary to specify the name of the <span class="itemelement">SMTP server</span>,
    the <span class="itemelement">port</span> where smtp service is offered (it it's not specified, default port 25 will
    be used), in case a user authentication is required, to select <span class="itemelement">Authentication
    required </span> and specify<span class="itemelement"> Username</span> and
    <span class="itemelement">Password</span>. This parameters are the ones used
    in your e-mail client software, therefore all you'll need to do is &quot;copy&quot;
    them from a working e-mail account (to make sure the SMTP server is reachable
    just click on the <span class="itemelement">Connection test</span> button).
    The <span class="itemelement">SSL</span> checkbox enables SSL communication,
    which may be needed by some SMTP servers (a typical example is Gmail's SMTP
    server).
<blockquote>
  <p class="item"><font color="#FF0000">Tip:</font>
    <span class="itemelement">Profiles</span> button allows to manage multiple SMTP
    settings. Account information can be
    stored for multiple profiles, so all SMTP settings are saved/loaded
    with a couple of clicks.This feature is specially usefull when sending mails
    on behalf or someone else.

</blockquote>
    By enabling the <span class="itemelement">Retry with direct send in case of
    error</span>, in case the message won't be accepted by the SMTP server, the
    software will try to deliver the message directly to the recipient's e-mail
    server, by using the <span class="itemelement">Direct send</span> mode.</li>
</p>
<p>
  <li class="item">By selecting <span class="itemelement">Direct send</span> the
    software will look for each recipient's e-mail server and will automatically
    connect to it, therefore &quot;skipping&quot; the SMTP server that won't then
    be needed in the send settings. Keep in mind that certain e-mail domains (for instance,
    hotmail) won't allow direct sends: the message gets rejected if it was originated
    from a desktop system as opposed to a public SMTP server.<br>

    <span class="itemelement">Use SMTP server</span> settings.<br>

<p><font color="#009900"></font><strong><font color="#009900">Use direct send
        or the SMTP server?</font></strong></p>
      <p>The choice depends, first of all, on the availability of a good SMTP
        server. If your ISP SMTP server is able to handle many messages in fast
        sequence, or even sending more messages simultaneously, using an SMTP
        server is faster and more reliable, since your SMTP server is &quot;closer&quot;
        to your computer than the single recipient's e-mail server.</p>
      <p>However, some providers, to prevent their users from using the server 
        for spamming purposes, impose restrictions on the number of messages that 
        can be sent within a specific time span and the number of messages that
        can be sent simultaneously (for instance, an SMTP server could accept 
        no more than a message every 5 seconds and not allow sending more than 
        2 messages at a time). All messages that exceed these restrictions will 
        be rejected with an error. This does not mean that the server or the software
        aren't working properly, but rather, that it will be necessary to set 
        in a different way the sending timing option in the <span class="itemelement">Advanced 
        settings</span> section.</p>
      <p>In such cases, it could be faster and more convenient to use the direct
        send. The direct send requires a little more time to deliver each message
        (since it has to make a request to the DNS server and the e-mail server 
        could be very &quot;far&quot; form the user's PC), however this time increase
        is compensated by the possibility to send more messages simultaneously
        without having to add extra pauses between messages.</p>
      <p>Direct send is also useful when a sending operation has to be performed 
        using a connection without knowing the SMTP server (typically the case
        when using a notebook &quot;away&quot;, meaning not in the office or at
        home - common in the case of a public access wireless network).</p>

<p class="item">The <span class="itemelement">Advanced settings</span> section 
  allows you to fine-tune the sending timing, and other special settings.
  This is useful to perform a sending
  operation at the maximum possible speed allowed by the SMTP server antispam
  restrictions. Here's the meaning of each options:</p>
  <p class="itemelement">
  Timing Tab
  </p>
<ul class="item">
  <li><span class="itemelement">Pause between messages</span>: the number of seconds

  <li><span class="itemelement">Messages per block</span>: the number of messages

  <li><span class="itemelement">Connections</span>: the maximum number of simultaneous

  <li><span class="itemelement">Further attempts in case of error</span>: If
    the SMTP server or the recipient's server (for a direct send) doesn't accept
    the
    message, the software can wait a certain number of seconds and retry sending
    the message one or more times.</li>
  <li><span class="itemelement">Pause between attempts</span>: the number of seconds 
    of delay before retrying to send an unaccepted message.</li>
</ul>
<p class="item">The right configuration cannot be set before a few attempts, verifying
  the number of messages that actually get delivered. To simplify the settings,
  some <span class="itemelement">Suggested settings</span> are available. They
  might not be optimized for your connection but can be considered a good starting
  point to get to the best configuration.</p>
<p class="item"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Warning:</font></strong> Distribution
   lists can contain invalid e-mail addresses, or some e-mail servers may be
  temporarily
  inactive. Therefore, when using lists that contain a great deal of addresses
   it should be considered normal and inevitable that, despite the chosen sending
  
  mode and the settings, not all messages get delivered and a certain percentage
   will return an error. In such case it will be possible to try to complete
  the 
  sending operation at a later time using the <a href="sendblaster_messages_history.htm">history</a>
  functions.</p>

    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFF99" class="item"> <p><font color="#009900"><strong>How 
        can I get the right advanced settings?</strong></font></p>
      <p>To get the right advanced settings it's necessary to try out different
        combinations (normally a list with about 10 addresses will suffice) and
        verify how many messages actually get delivered (this info is given at
        the end of the sending operation, when it is also possible to check the
        logs). Users connected to a &quot;tolerant&quot; enough SMTP server won't
        probably experience many problems, regardless of the settings specified
        that will only effect the sending speed.<br>
        On the other hand, if your connection is to a rather &quot;strict&quot;
        STMP server, in order to be able to deliver a high number of messages
        it might be necessary to slow down message sending and avoid sending messages
        simultaneously. </p>
      <p>Here's a few simple rules worth considering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A tolerant SMTP server allows fast sending without pauses (or limited
          pauses anyway). On rather restricted SMTP servers that use numerous
          antispam filters, raise pauses and lower simultaneous connections.</li>
        <li>Normally, SMTP servers don't allow sending many messages simultaneously,
          therefore when using the SMTP mode the number of connections must be
          low or, in certain situations, equal to 1 (no simultaneous connections).
          If the SMTP server is equipped with antispam restriction mechanisms, 
          it may be necessary to slow down message sending by setting a pause
          of a few seconds between each send, and set a longer pause between message
          blocks. Also, blocks shouldn't contain more than a few dozen messages.</li>
        <li>In case of a direct send, with a standard distribution list containing
          addresses belonging to different domains, the messages will be delivered
          to a variety of different servers: it is therefore possible to set
          a
          high number of connections* and limited (or none at all) pauses between
          messages and between blocks.</li>
        <li>Raising the number of attempts in case of error can raise the percentage 
          of success but it will slow down the sending operation, particularly 
          if the number of simultaneous connections is low. Completing the operation 
          at a later time from the <a href="sendblaster_messages_history.htm">history</a> 
          window (after having waited a few minutes) can be considered good practice.</li>

  <li><span class="itemelement">Domain</span>: allows for customizing
  the machine name used by the software for connecting to SMTP server or recipients'
  email servers. This can be useful when using <span class="itemelement">Direct
  send</span>: some servers verify domain name before accepting messages; they
  require that domain name corresponds to the public <em>hostname</em> on the
  network, and before accepting messages they perform a <em>ping</em> (or similar
  operation) in order to verify that domain name corresponds to the IP address
  of the machine requesting connection. Should this be the case, selecting <span class="itemelement">Internet
  address </span> may lower refused messages. We suggest using default settings,
  or using <span class="itemelement">Internet address</span> when direct sending
  and <span class="itemelement">PC local name</span> when using SMTP (SMTP servers
  usually don't perform any particular check on domain name).<br>
  SendBlaster checks your machine's public address each time it is started; should
  Internet connection not be available when starting, public address may be left
  empty and PC local name will be used instead. If a fixed public IP is available,
  experienced users will select <span class="itemelement">User defined...</span>
  and enter a fixed value (please note that a <em>hostname</em> is needed - not
  an IP address) - but keep in mind that a wrong setting could compromise successful
  sending.  </li>
  <li><span class="itemelement">Manually set DNS Server</span>: SendBlaster will use the currently selected
  default connection DNS, but it is also possible (and sometimes needed) to manually set a different DNS,
  by enabling this option and typing the correct IP address.  </li>
  <li><span class="itemelement">Ignore Socket Errors</span>: if there is any problem with the connection to the Internet, either due to hardware or software problems, SendBlaster will pause the mailing, alert the user and wait for user instructions - in most cases, a human intervention is in fact required (i.e. you may need to reset your network hardware, etc). If you don't want the mailing to be paused, and prefer SendBlaster to simply ignore the errors, check this option (be warned that, if there is no connection to the Internet, the mailing could fail). This is useful when your Internet connection sometimes goes down for any reason (i.e. wifi problems) but it is automatically restored in a short time. </li>
