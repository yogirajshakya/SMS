<p class="title"><strong>What's new in sendBlaster 2</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">Improved and redesigned user interface<br>
  </strong>SendBlaster is even 
    easier to use than before. Users can choose between the classic left panel, 
    redesigned to be visually more appealing and now supporting large or small 
    icons, and a new toolbar which saves horizontal space on the screen. All panels 
    are now scrollable with the mouse wheel; list selection can be synchronized 
    across all the panels and are alphabetically ordered; all icons have been 
    redesigned; and many more small user interface improvements have been added.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">Scheduled mailings<br>
  </strong>Now users can create a mailing and let 
    SendBlaster 2 send it later automatically, at a given day and time. Or, users 
    can even &quot;park&quot; their mailing so that they can manually launch it 
    later. Now SendBlaster can run in a minimized schedule mode and start when 
    Windows starts.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li> <span class="item"><strong class="title">E-mail tracking<br>
  </strong>SendBlaster 2 has built-in support, wizards 
    and panels for Google Analytics, Google's campaign monitoring free service, 
    and for TrackReports, our advanced tracking and reporting online service.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">New, powerful data filters<br>
  </strong>A powerful filter has been added, 
    which lets users fine tune their mailing by selecting and enabling or disabling 
    records matching some conditions. It supports multiple conditions and complex 
    operators, so that they can visually build a powerful SQL query without writing 
    code. Duplicates can now be filtered out automatically, as in release 1, or 
    managed by the user through a new, powerful search engine.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">More options for sending out<br>
  </strong>Users can now add custom headers, 
    request read receipts, set a high priority for their message, define a customized 
    To: header supporting merge tags, enable or disable automatic filtering out 
    of duplicate addresses when sending out.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">More options for editing messages<br>
  </strong>Many new buttons in the 
    composer panel let users easily add removal links in the message, add special 
    links for Google Analytics and TrackReports, and add merge tags in the subject 
    and To: field. Now text-only (as opposed to HTML) messages can more easily 
    be created by just checking one box.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li> <span class="item"><strong class="title">Spam checking<br>
  </strong>It is now possible to perform a spam-score 
    check on the fly while editing a message; spam score checking is based on 
    popular SpamAssassin engine, one of the most common antispam filters with 
    e-mail servers.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">Preview with merge tags<br>
  </strong>Previewing now supports substituting 
    merge tags too, so that users can have a more exact idea of what will be sent.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">More speed<br>
  </strong>SendBlaster now supports up to 50 connections 
    - this could dramatically improve the speed of mailings when using a fast 
    SMTP server. Furthermore, SendBlaster now gives users the option to not interrupt 
    a mailing should the Internet connection temporarily stop working, which may 
    help with unattended mailings.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">Customizable subscription and bounce-back formats<br>
  </strong>Users 
    can now customize subscription and cancellation subjects and add custom bounce-back 
    formats for easier, automatic processing of undelivered messages.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">SMTP and POP3 profiles<br>
  </strong>Using multiple SMTP and POP3 settings 
    is easier than before - account info can be saved in multiple profiles, so 
    that all SMTP and/or POP3 settings can be changed with a couple of clicks. 
    This is expecially useful when sending out mailings on behalf of someone else.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li> <span class="item"><strong class="title">Snapshots<br>
  </strong>Save all settings for any given panel and reuse 
    them later with just one click - it's as easy as taking a snapshot. Snapshots 
    extend the concept of &quot;profiles&quot; to a new level - almost every group 
    of related settings in SendBlaster can be saved as a snapshot.</span><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="title"><strong>Support for external plug-ins<br>
  </strong></span><span class="item">Users can download free plug-ins 
    (small tools performing specific tasks, as importing from various e.mail clients, 
    etc) from our web site, and many more will be added in the future. Plugins 
    API is public and third party developers are encouraged to create new, useful 
    plugins.</span><br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li> <span class="item"><strong class="title">New, easier-to-edit templates<br>
  </strong>SendBlaster 2 has more than 
    100 new professionally designed templates, all of them using flexible layouts 
    which can be easily customized.</span><br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">Easier access to data files<br>
  </strong>Directly accessing database 
    files for backup purposes is now easier, as they are saved inside Documents 
    folder</span>.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><span class="item"><strong class="title">No administration privileges required<br>
  </strong>SendBlaster 2 can 
    be run by standard users on any Windows system</span>    <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong class="title">Ready for Windows 7</strong><br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item"><strong class="title">And much more!<br>
  </strong>SendBlaster 2 has many more small improvements 
    which let users work better and faster.</li>
