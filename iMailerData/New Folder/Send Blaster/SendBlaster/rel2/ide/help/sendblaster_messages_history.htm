<p class="title">History</p>
<p class="item">This window allows you to see the list of all sent messages. In 
  case a mailing operation was not completed (for example if your SMTP server 
  won't allow sending more than a certain number of e-mails in a short period 
  of time) it is possible to resume sending from the point where it was interrupted, 
  sending the message to all the recipients not included in the original sending 
  operation. </p>
<p class="item">Each mailing operation gets marked with the send date, the list 
  name to which the message was sent and the subject.</p>
<p class="item">Click on the <span class="itemelement">E-mail preview</span> button 
  (or select the corresponding command with a right mouse click) to show the message 
  sent for the selected entry.</p>
<p class="item">The <span class="itemelement">Address list </span>allows you to 
  see a list of all addresses to which the message was sent. All addresses to 
  which the message was successfully sent are shown in green, while addresses 
  shown in red are the ones to which delivery failed.</p>
<p class="item">The <span class="itemelement">Log</span> button shows the send 
  log, which is the <em>dialog </em>that took place with the SMTP server (or with 
  the destination servers in case of a direct send).</p>
<p class="item">In case one or more addresses were not included in the mailing
   operation, the last column of the list (for incomplete entries) will show
  the 
  button <img src="img/sendblaster_messages_history_1.gif" width="16" height="16">.
   Clicking it will enable you to complete the sending operation using the current
  
  sending options, as specified in then <a href="sendblaster_messages_send.htm" class="itemlink"><span class="itemelement">Send</span></a> 
  tab. The message will then be sent to all recipients that did not yet receive
   it (the red addresses in the Address list window).</p>
<p class="item">History items can be deleted by selecting them (use the <em>Ctrl</em> 
  key on the keyboard to select multiple elements or use <em>Shift </em>to select 
  a group) and by clicking on the <span class="itemelement">Delete items</span> 
  button.</p>
<p class="item">Delivered and undelivered addresses can be exported as a text 
  file using <span class="itemelement">Export delivered</span> and <span class="itemelement">Export 
  undelivered</span> buttons. Exporting undelivered addresses may also be useful 
  when you want to purge lists from bad addresses: you can later <a href="sendblaster_lists_import.htm" class="itemlink">import 
  the file</a> selecting remove or unsubscribe options.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">

    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFF99" class="item"> <p><strong><font color="#009900">When 
        is it useful to use the History functionalities? </font></strong></p>
      <p>Completing a message sending operation through the History functionalities 
        is a great way to work around SMTP server restrictions that wouldn't otherwise 
        allow sending several messages in a short time span. SMTP server restrictions 
        could be such that, despite settings in <span class="itemelement">Advance 
        settings</span> of the <a href="sendblaster_messages_send.htm" class="itemlink"><span class="itemelement">Send</span></a> 
        tab, won't allow completion of a sending operation in a single step. For 
        instance, in a situation where you have a server that won't allow sending 
        more than 50 messages per hour and a distribution list with 100 addresses, 
        only the first half will go through during the first attempt. After a 
        one-hour wait the operation can be completed from the History window.</p>
      <p>Exporting undelivered (red) addresses may also be useful when you want 
        to purge lists from bad addresses.</p>
