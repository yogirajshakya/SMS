<p class="title">Manage lists</p>
<p class="item">SendBlaster can manage multiple distribution lists*. </p>
<p class="item">The current list is selected through the drop-down box found in 
  the upper side of the window. Next to it, you can find 3 buttons that will let 
  you to create a new list (button <span class="itemelement">New</span><span class="item">), 
  rename the current list (</span><span class="itemelement">Rename</span><span class="item">), 
  delete it (</span><span class="itemelement">Delete</span><span class="item">) 
  or send it to the printer (</span><span class="itemelement">Print</span><span class="item">)</span><span class="item">. 
  These tasks can also be performed by clicking on the drop-down box with the 
  right mouse button.</span></p>
<p class="item">The remaining area of the window is dedicated to the address list 
  of the selected distribution list.</p>
<p class="item">Each address shows: the subscription state (marked by the <img src="img/sendblaster_lists_managing_1.gif" width="12" height="12"> 
  and <img src="img/sendblaster_lists_managing_2.gif" width="12" height="12"> 
  icons), the activation state (marked by a checkbox), the contents of the 15
  <a href="sendblaster_settings_fields.htm" class="itemlink">custom fields</a> 
  (the first one is always the e-mail address), the presence of comments (marked 
  by the <img src="img/sendblaster_lists_managing_3.gif" width="15" height="10"> 
  icon, clicking on it will open the comments). Columns order can be modified 
  by moving columns (simply drag the column header). The columns can also be resized. 
</p>
<p class="item">During a <a href="sendblaster_messages_send.htm" class="itemlink">send 
  operation</a>, the addresses marked as unsubscribed or inactive will be skipped. 
  The sending operation will therefore affect only those addresses that are currently 
  both subscribed and active. You can easily detect the addresses that will not 
  be included in mailings since they are shown in grey:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td><img src="img/sendblaster_lists_managing_4.gif" width="156" height="94"></td>
    <td valign="middle" class="item">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="100%" valign="top" class="item">In the example to the left a mailing
      operation will only affect the first address since it is the only one both 
      subscribed and active.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="item">The address list can be freely sorted by clicking on column headers. 
  Dragging one or more column headers in the area above the list (<span class="itemelement">Drag 
  a column header in this area to group data</span>) will let you to group addresses
  based on the contents of the selected fields. The <span class="itemelement">Total
  </span>checkbox will also be shown, enabling you (when checked) to find out 
  the number of addresses included in each group.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFF99" class="item"> <p><font color="#009900"><strong>How 
        to filter addresses</strong></font></p>
      <p>Temporairily activating/deactivating one or more items (without having
        to unsubscribe them) will allow you to send a message to a subgroup of
        addresses in the list. With this feature you will be able to create powerful filtering to be applied
        to mailing processes. </p>
      <p>For instance, if a &quot;City&quot; field is defined you can send a message
        only to those that live in a specific city, temporarily disabling all
        other addresses. If a &quot;Job&quot; field is defined you'll be able
        to send a message only to certain professional categories (it will also
        be possible to combine these 2 filters.</p>
      <p>SendBlaster provides a powerfull data filter builder which lets users fine tune their
      mailing by selecting and enabling or disabling records matching some conditions. It supports
      multiple conditions and complex operators, so that they can visually
      build a powerful SQL query without writing code. This filter builder can be
      accessed using the <span class="itemelement">Filter</span> button.</p>
      <p>Disabling of one or more addresses will also enable you to create exclusion
        lists (addresses to which no message will ever be sent, not even if the
        user will spontaneously subscribe to the list).</p>

  modify the selected address (<span class="itemelement">Modify</span>) or delete

  multiple addresses using both the keyboard and the mouse: clicking on an address

<span class="itemelement">Subscribe/Unsubscribe</span> them, you can also
choose to <span class="itemelement">Deactivate</span> non matching contacts, or just leave them as they are.
