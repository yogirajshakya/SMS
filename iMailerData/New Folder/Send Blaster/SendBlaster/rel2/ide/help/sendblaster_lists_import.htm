<p class="title">Importing</p>
<p class="item">You can import data from an external source into the currently
   selected list. There are four accepted sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="item"> You can import data from a formatted text file (.csv, .txt), 
    residing on the local machine or the local network, by selecting <span class="itemelement">Import 
    form external text file</span>. &#8220;Formatted text&#8221; is an exchange 
    format widely used by spreadsheet and database software: most software that 
    falls into this category is able to export data in this format.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item">You can import data from a web site by choosing<span class="itemelement"> 
    Import from a web site via http://</span>. The process is very similar to 
    the formatted text method, besides the fact that the file to be imported does 
    not reside on the local machine or the local network but it is reachable through 
    the HTTP protocol. The data to be imported can also be dynamically generated 
    by a script (for example ASP or PHP). This method will allow you to import 
    the contents of an on-line database that features an exporting script. The 
    web link will be specified as the data source.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item">You can import data from the Windows Clipboard (after having 
    pasted data from another software), by selecting <span class="itemelement">Import 
    from clipboard</span>.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item">You can import data from Outlook Express Address Book (aka 
    Windows Address Book), by selecting <span class="itemelement">Import from 
    Outlook Express</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="item">The data loaded from external sources can be used for one of the 
  following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="item">It can be added to the selected list by choosing the <span class="itemelement">Add 
    to the list and subscribe new addresses</span>.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item">It can be removed from the selected list by choosing the <span class="itemelement">Remove 
    new addresses from the list</span> option. All the addresses included in the 
    data source will be removed, if present.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item">It can be unsubscribed from the list (without removing them 
    and therefore preserving the data) by choosing the <span class="itemelement">Unsubscribe 
    new addresses</span> option. This operation is similar to the one described 
    above, but the addresses are not removed form the list, they simply get marked 
    as unsubscribed. This method will let you to maintain the data in the list 
    while avoiding including the addresses in mailing operations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="item">After having selected the list, the data source and the operation, 
  click on the <span class="itemelement">Import</span> button. A wizard-like window 
  will be shown enabling you to specify a few options needed to complete the importing 
  operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="item"> The <span class="itemelement">Import file path</span>, or 
    the <span class="itemelement">Import file URL</span> in the case of a web 
    import (importing form the Clipboard or from Outlook Express do not require 
    any path).<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item">The data <span class="itemelement">Format</span> (not needed 
    to import from Outlook Express): if you choose <span class="itemelement">Delimited</span> 
    you&#8217;ll also need to specify the <span class="itemelement">Field delimiter</span> 
    and whether the <span class="itemelement">First row contains field names</span>. 
    By choosing the <span class="itemelement">Free</span> format only e-mail addresses 
    will be imported (automatically detected) and data format specification won&#8217;t 
    be needed.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item">If you&#8217;re performing a typical importing operation (meaning 
    data adding, or the <span class="itemelement">Add to list and subscribe new 
    addresses</span> operation), two extra options will be available to indicate 
    the action to take when an external address (present in the data to be imported) 
    is already included in the destination list: by choosing the <span class="itemelement">Don&#8217;t 
    add addresses when duplicated or already present in the list</span> option, 
    these addresses will be ignored (otherwise they would be added creating doubles); 
    by choosing the <span class="itemelement">Subscribe addresses already present 
    in list </span>option, if an address is already in the destination list, but 
    not subscribed (see <a href="sendblaster_lists_managing.htm" class="itemelement">Manage 
    lists</a>), new data won&#8217;t be imported but the address will be marked 
    as subscribed.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li class="item">In the following step you will be finally asked to set the 
    correspondence between the external data source fields and the SendBlaster 
    fields and, by clicking on the <span class="itemelement">Next</span> button, 
    the importing operation will start.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="item"><a href="sendblaster_snapshots.htm" class="itemelement">Snapshots</a> are particularly handy when importing: if you successfully imported a file, take a snapshot of your configuration in order to save the settings you used; you will be able to reuse them later with just a couple of clicks.</span></p>
<p class="item"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Warning:</font></strong> the correct 
  indication of the field in the external data source containing e-mail addresses 
  is particularly important because:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="item"><strong>all the external records that do not contain, in the 
    selected field, a formally valid e-mail address will be ignored</strong>. 
    Therefore if the wrong field is specified, no record will include a valid 
    e-mail address and all of the external data will be ignored.</li>
  <li class="item">the comparison operation between the external data and the 
    data in the list, to verify if an address is already included, is actually 
    performed by comparing the e-mail address found in the specified field.</li>
</ol>
