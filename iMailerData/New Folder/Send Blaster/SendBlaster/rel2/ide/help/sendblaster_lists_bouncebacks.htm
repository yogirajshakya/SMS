<p class="title"> Manage bounce-backs</p>
<p class="item">A bounced e-mail (or <em>bounce-back</em>) is one that never arrives 
  in the recipient's inbox and is sent back, or bounced back, to the sender with 
  an error message that indicates to the sender that the e-mail was never successfully 
  transmitted. Typically, this happens when you send your mailings using Smtp 
  servers: if an address is non-existent, Smtp server (which has no way of knowing 
  it) will accept the message anyway, but it will be bounced later.</p>
<p class="item">There are two main types of bounce-backs:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="item">Hard bounces: the e-mail could not be delivered due to a permanent 
    error (i.e. non-existent address)</li>
  <li class="item">Soft bounces: A temporary condition exists causing the email
    delivery to fail (i.e. the recipient's mail server is temporarily busy)</li>
</ul>
<p class="item">SendBlaster can automatically recognize most* bounced e-mails and
  unsubscribe or delete bounced addresses in the selected list.</p>
<p class="item">Bounced mails will be sent to the mailing's sender address, which 
  may not be the same address used for subscriptions and cancellations (see <span class="itemlink"><a href="sendblaster_lists_managing.htm" class="itemelement">Manage 
  subscriptions</a></span>). Therefore it is necessary to tell the program which 
  address should be checked.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#FFFF99" class="item"> <p><font color="#009900"><strong>Which 
        address should I enter?</strong></font></p>
      <p>Remember that e-mail bounces are sent to the mailing's sender address, 
        not to the address used for subscriptions. Suppose you chose &quot;subscriptions@mysite.com&quot; 
        as your subscriptions managing address for List 1, and you later sent 
        your mailings from &quot;newsletter@mysite.com&quot; address. Bounce-backs 
        will therefore be delivered to &quot;newsletter@mysite.com&quot;, and 
        this is the address you will have to configure in <span class="itemelement">Manage 
        bounce-backs</span> section for List 1.</p>
      </td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="item">The address to check is set by typing the correct parameters to 
  access its POP3 account, just like any e-mail client software: besides
  the address (<span class="itemelement">E-mail</span>) you need to specify the
  receiving server (<span class="itemelement">POP3 Server</span>), the
  <span class="itemelement">Port</span> number (if no port is specified, default port
  110 will be used), the <span class="itemelement">Username</span>
  and the <span class="itemelement">Password</span>. The <span class="itemelement">SSL</span>
  checkbox enables SSL communication, which may be needed by some pop3 servers
  (a typical example is Gmail's server). In the <span class="itemelement">Timeout</span>
  field you can type the number of seconds of inactivity after which the connection
  will be closed. To verify the parameters just click on <span class="itemelement">Connection
  test</span> button (no message will be downloaded).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="item"><font color="#FF0000">Tip:</font>
    <span class="itemelement">Profiles</span> button allows to manage multiple POP3
    settigs. Account information can be
    stored for multiple profiles, so all POP3 settings are saved/loaded
    with a couple of clicks. This feature is specially usefull when sending mails
    on behalf or someone else.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="item">By checking <span class="itemelement">Keep a copy of the messages
  on the server once downloaded</span>, SendBlaster will download new messages without deleting
  them from the server. The messages will then be available for future uses. New
  messages will be ignored.</p>
<p class="item">By checking <span class="itemelement">Only delete new bounce-back messages</span>
 SendBlaster will delete only this messages, leaving the rest of the messages in the server.</p>
<p class="item"> If <span class="itemelement">Delete bounced addresses </span>is 
  checked, bounced addresses will be deleted from the selected list. If not, they 
  will just be unsubscribed from the list.</p>
<p class="item">By checking <span class="itemelement">Process hard bounces</span> 
  and <span class="itemelement">Process soft bounces </span> you can choose which 
  bounce types (see above) should be processed; of course if neither option is 
  checked no bounced e-mails processing will occur.</p>
<p class="item">By clicking on the <span class="itemelement">Download</span> button, 
  the new messages will be downloaded and the selected distribution list will 
  be updated (as well as all other lists that use the same e-mail address for 
  bounce-backs).</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="item"><font color="#FF0000">Warning:</font> if the download of new 
    messages appears to be rather slow, this might indicate that on the e-mail 
    server many messages have piled up: disable the <span class="itemelement">Keep 
    a copy of the messages on the server</span> option and click on <span class="itemelement">Download</span> 
    (or execute downloading on your standard e-mail client). The messages, once 
    downloaded, will be removed form the server and the following downloads will 
    be faster.</p>
