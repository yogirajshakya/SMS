  <p class=title>FAQ</p>
  <p class=item><strong>When I send a message to several recipients, can they 
    all see everyone else&#8217;s address?</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 

  <p class=item>No, SendBlaster sends each message separately: the recipients&#8217; 
    privacy is preserved. Using SendBlaster to manage multiple sends is therefore 
    useful to prevent accidentally showing of other people&#8217;s e-mail address, 
    which would be a violation of privacy rules.<br>
      &nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=item><strong>How can I filter a list?</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    
  <p class=item>Using the sorting/grouping functions in the <a href="sendblaster_lists_managing.htm" class="itemelement">Manage
    lists</a> section, and temporarily enabling/disabling a group of addresses,
    will allow you to send a message to a subgroup of the addresses in the current
    list. You can also use the <span class="itemelement">Filter</span> button.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=item><strong>How can I insert in the message body a link to unsubscribe 
    from the mailing list?</strong></p>
  
<blockquote> 
  <p class=item>SendBlaster can manage its distribution lists by downloading messages 
    from a dedicated e-mail address, different for each list (see <a href="sendblaster_lists_subscribe.htm" class="itemelement">Manage 
    subscriptions</a>). Using the <span class="itemelement">Insert unsubscription link</span> button, when
    composing a message, you will insert a link like:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p class=valore>&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:#managingemail#?Subject=Unsubscribe&quot;&gt;Unsubscribe&lt;/a&gt;</p>
    </blockquote>

  <p class=item>The HTML code will inserted in the HTML section of
    the message, you can review/edit it by clicking on <span class="itemelement">Show code</span>.

  <p class=item><strong>When I send a message to a mailing list, some of the messages 
    don&#8217;t get delivered and are returned with an error.</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    
  <p class=item>When sending to lots of addresses it is normal that not all of
    the messages go through: some of the addresses could have become inactive
    or be temporarily jammed, e-mail servers could be overloaded, the connection
    could be momentarily interrupted or slow.</p>
    
    <p class=item>If the percentage of sent messages is very low, or even no
    message  is sent, it is necessary to check the <a href="sendblaster_messages_send.htm" class="itemlink">Send Settings</a>.</p>
    
    
  <p class=item>Actually, it could be necessary to change the send mode (direct
    or through SMTP) and, if your SMTP server uses antispam filters, lower the
    number of connections and raise the pause between messages. The SMTP server
    could have restrictions that will prevent you from sending more than a certain
    number of messages within a specific time span (for instance a given server
    may not allow sending more than 50 e-mails per hour); in such case, after
    the first send, the operation will be completed at a later time using the
    <a href="sendblaster_messages_history.htm" class="itemelement">History</a>
    functions.</p>
    
  <p class=item>If the SMTP server antispam restrictions can&#8217;t be overridden
    and sending operations will go through only with very slow settings, you can
    try with the direct send or by using a &#8220;more tolerant&#8221; SMTP server
    (on the Internet it is possible to subscribe, even for a low price, to very
    efficient SMTP services).</p>
    <p class=item>If the problem arises while using the direct send mode, it may
      be necessary to manually specify the IP address of the DNS server.<br>

  <p class=item><strong>I&#8217;ve lost the password and I can&#8217;t access
    the program anymore. What can I do?</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    
  <p class=item>You need to be aware that it won&#8217;t be possible to recover
    lost data. The following procedure will only enable you to regain access to
    the software.</p>
    
  <p class=item>1. Uninstall the software from the Windows Control Panel.</p>
    
  <p class=item>2. Manually remove the installation folder (i.e. <i>C.\Program
    files\SendBlaster</i>), including all the subfolders; for security reasons,
    in the event the software gets uninstalled, the database will not be automatically
    removed (this is why you need to delete it manually).</p>
    <p class=item>3. Install the software again.</p>
