<p class="title">SendBlaster</p>
<p class="item"><strong>Sendblaster</strong> is designed to send in a rapid and
   automated fashion numerous e-mail messages to several distribution lists.
  The 
  sophisticated data engine, and the ability to send personalized messages (&#8220;Dear
   Mr. John Smith&#8221;, instead of an anonymous &#8220;Dear customer&#8221;)
    will allow you to create automated newsletters and ad campaigns. All through
   a 
  software that runs on your desktop.</p>
<p class="item">Thanks to the <b>SmartSend</b> engine it is possible to send
  several  messages simultaneously, even without an SMTP server, making sending
  messages 
  safer and easier than through a standard e-mail client. Each message is sent
  separately. The recipients&#8217; privacy is protected. Using SendBlaster to
  manage multiple sends is also useful to prevent from accidentally revealing
  other people&#8217;s
     e-mail address.</p>
<p class="item">The messages can be composed directly into the software, with
  a  complete set of formatting tools, or imported from external files (HTML
  pages, 
  previously saved <i>.eml</i> messages &#8211; for instance from Outlook). The
   editing and importing functions will allow you to insert images directly into
  
  the message body, therefore avoiding linking to external files (the latest
  e-mail  clients don&#8217;t allow it or  will generate a security warning).</p>
<p class="item">The distribution lists management is highly optimized: with a few 
  clicks you&#8217;ll be able to create new lists, modify existing ones and import 
  addresses from external sources. It&#8217;s possible to import data from:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="item">A formatted text file (.csv)</li>
  <li class="item">Outlook Express</li>
  <li class="item">The clipboard</li>
  <li class="item">A web page</li>
</ul>
<p class="item">It is also possible to receive subscribe/unsubscribe messages
   on a dedicated e-mail address, different for each distribution list: to subscribe
  
  to a list all is needed is to send an e-mail to this address with &#8220;Subscribe&#8221; 
  in the object field (or &#8220;Unsubscribe&#8221; to be removed). The software
   downloads the messages and automatically updates the corresponding distribution
  
  lists.</p>
<p class="item">Managing subscriptions through e-mails and the possibility to
  import data from a web source will allow you to easily add mailing list functionalities
  
  to your web site, letting SendBlaster take care of updating the lists and send
   the messages to the right recipients (therefore avoiding sending messages
  to 
  people not supposed to receive them).</p>
<p class="item">The distribution list e-mail management is rather sophisticated: 
  the addresses can be enabled or disabled with a single click, and it is possible 
  to filter the data in a very advanced way, based on the contents of one or more 
  fields. Combining these two functionalities will allow you to send messages 
  to a very specific subgroup of addresses in a specific list (for instance, only 
  the people living in a certain area, or the contacts that run a specific business). 
</p>
<p class="item">The software also recognizes new subscriptions and is therefore
   possible to send a message only to people who have never received it before.
  
  The fields can be customized and there are several search options. Each address
   can be associated with &#8220;PostIt&#8221; style notes, whose contents are
   also  searchable.</p>

      <p class="item">Here&#8217;s how to compose and send a message in a few simple 
        steps:</p>
      <p class="item"><strong>1. Compose a message:</strong> in the <span class="itemelement">Messages</span> 
        panel click on <a href="sendblaster_messages_compose.htm" class="itemlink">Compose 
        message</a>; and compose the message  (adding images as well) or import 
        it from an external file (for instance an e-mail previously saved with 
        Outlook Express). At this time is it can be useful to explore the use 
        of the markers, that will be substituted by the real recipients data: 
        <i>Dear</i> <i>#name#</i> will become <i>Dear John Smith</i>.</p>
      <p class="item"><strong>2. Define an address list:</strong> click on <a href="sendblaster_lists_managing.htm" class="itemlink">List management</a> in the<span class="itemelement"> Lists and addresses </span>panel. 
        Insert new addresses in the default list or create a new list, for instance 
        using the <a href="sendblaster_lists_import.htm" class="itemlink">Importing 
        da Outlook Express</a> function; try the grouping functions by dragging 
        the column header in the special area above the column header and by enabling/disabling 
        addresses.</p>
        
      <p class="item"><strong>3. Send the message:</strong> in the <span class="itemelement">Messages</span> 
        panel click on <a href="sendblaster_messages_send.htm" class="itemlink">Send</a>; 
        choose the recipients&#8217; list and specify the SMTP server connection 
        parameters  or try the direct send (in which case you can try specifying 
        very fast sending options).</p></td>
